## 🎨 Visual Indicators

### **Completion Rate Colors:**
- 🟢 **100%** - All LGUs completed (Success)
- 🔵 **75-99%** - Most completed (Info)
- 🟡 **50-74%** - Half completed (Warning)
- 🔴 **0-49%** - Needs attention (Error)

### **Status Badges:**
- ✅ **Completed** - Activity finished
- ⏳ **In Progress** - Currently working
- ⚪ **Not Started** - Not yet begun

---

## 📋 How to Use

### **Monitoring Overall Progress:**
1. Go to **SMV Monitoring → Analytics**
2. Check the **Overall Timeline Progress** card
3. Review key metrics:
   - When project started
   - Latest activity date
   - Total duration
   - Overall completion rate

### **Monitoring Stage Progress:**
1. Scroll to **Stage-by-Stage Progress** section
2. Each stage shows:
   - Numbered badge (1-6)
   - Stage name
   - Completion percentage
   - LGU count (completed / total)
   - Progress bar with color coding
   - Status breakdown
   - Timeline information

### **Identifying Bottlenecks:**
1. Look for stages with **low completion rates** (red/yellow)
2. Check **"Not Started"** counts - these need attention
3. Compare **"In Progress"** vs **"Completed"** ratios
4. Review timeline info to see if stage is taking too long

### **Tracking Timeline:**
1. Note **"First completed"** date for each stage
2. Compare with **"Last completed"** date
3. Large gaps indicate uneven progress across LGUs
4. Use this to identify which LGUs need support

## 💡 Best Practices

### **Daily/Weekly Monitoring:**
1. **Check Analytics Tab**
   - Review overall completion rate
   - Identify stages below 50%
   - Note any stages with no progress

2. **Compare Across Stages**
   - Stages should progress sequentially
   - Red flag if Stage 4 is ahead of Stage 2
   - Look for logical flow

3. **Prioritize Actions**
   - Focus on stages with most "Not Started"
   - Follow up with LGUs showing no progress
   - Celebrate stages at 100%

### **Monthly Reporting:**
1. **Screenshot Analytics Tab** for documentation
2. **Track Month-over-Month Changes**:
   - Did completion rates improve?
   - Which stages made most progress?
   - Which LGUs are lagging?

3. **Compare Against Timeline**:
   - Are we on track for RO submission?
   - Which stages need acceleration?
   - Do we need deadline extensions?

### **Data-Driven Decisions:**
- Use stage completion rates to allocate support
- Identify common bottlenecks across LGUs
- Plan training/assistance for problem stages
- Set realistic expectations based on average durations
